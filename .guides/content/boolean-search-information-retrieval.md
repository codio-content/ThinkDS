The next phase of this project is to implement a search tool. The pieces we'll need include:



1. 
An interface where users can provide search terms and view results.

1. 
A lookup mechanism that takes each search term and returns the pages
that contain it.

1. 
Mechanisms for combining search results from multiple search terms.

1. 
Algorithms for ranking and sorting search results.


The general term for processes like this is “information retrieval”, which you can read more about at  [http://thinkdast.com/infret](http://thinkdast.com/infret).

In this exercise, we'll focus on steps 3 and 4. We've already built a simple version of 2. If you are interested in building Web applications, you might consider working on step 1.
