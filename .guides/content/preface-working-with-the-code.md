The code for this book is in a Git repository at [http://thinkdast.com/repo](http://thinkdast.com/repo).


Git is a “version control system” that allows you to keep track of the files that make up a project.  A collection of files under Git's control is called a “repository”.


GitHub is a hosting service that provides storage for Git repositories and a convenient web interface.  It provides several ways to work with the code:



*  You can create a copy of the repository on GitHub by pressing the **Fork** button.  If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one.  After forking, you'll have your own repository on GitHub that you can use to keep track of code you write.  Then you can “clone” the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to your computer.
*  Alternatively, you could clone the repository without forking. If you choose this option, you don't need a GitHub account, but you won't be able to save your changes on GitHub.
*  If you don't want to use Git at all, you can download the code in a ZIP archive using the **Download** button on the GitHub page, or this link: [http://thinkdast.com/zip](http://thinkdast.com/zip). 

After you clone the repository or unzip the ZIP file, you should have a directory called `ThinkDataStructures` with a subdirectory called `code`.

The examples in this book were developed and tested using Java SE Development Kit 7.  If you are using an older version, some examples will not work.  If you are using a more recent version, they should all work.
