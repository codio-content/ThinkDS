This book is an adapted version of a curriculum I wrote for the Flatiron School in New York City, which offers a variety of online classes related to programming and web development.  They offer a class based on this material, which provides an online development environment, help from instructors and other students, and a certificate of completion.  You can find more information at [http://flatironschool.com](http://flatironschool.com).




*  At the Flatiron School, Joe Burgess, Ann John, and Charles
Pletcher provided guidance, suggestions, and corrections from the
initial specification all the way through implementation and
testing.  Thank you all!

*  I am very grateful to my technical reviewers, Barry Whitman,
Patrick White, and Chris Mayfield, who made many helpful suggestions
and caught many errors.  Of course, any remaining errors are my
fault, not theirs!

*  Thanks to the instructors and students in Data Structures and
Algorithms at Olin College, who read this book and provided useful
feedback.

*  Charles Roumeliotis copyedited the book for O'Reilly Media
and made many improvements.
