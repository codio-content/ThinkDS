This book is intended for college students in computer science and related fields, as well as professional software engineers, people training in software engineering, and people preparing for technical interviews.

Before you start this book, you should know Java pretty well; in particular, you should know how to define a new class that extends an existing class or implements an `interface`. If your Java is rusty,  here are two books you might start with:



*  Downey and Mayfield, *Think Java* (O'Reilly Media, 2016), which is intended for people who have never programmed before.
*  Sierra and Bates, *Head First Java* (O'Reilly Media, 2005), which is appropriate for people who already know another programming language. 

If you are not familiar with interfaces in Java, you might want to work through the tutorial called “What Is an Interface?” at [http://thinkdast.com/interface](http://thinkdast.com/interface).


One vocabulary note: the word “interface” can be confusing. In the context of an **application programming interface** (API), it refers to a set of classes and methods that provide certain capabilities.


In the context of Java, it also refers to a language feature, similar to a class, that specifies a set of methods. To help avoid confusion, I'll use “interface” in the normal typeface for the general idea of an interface, and `interface` in the code typeface for the Java language feature.

You should also be familiar with type parameters and generic types. For example, you should know how create an object with a type parameter, like `ArrayList<Integer>`.  If not, you can read about type parameters at [http://thinkdast.com/types](http://thinkdast.com/types).


You should be familiar with the Java Collections Framework (JCF), which you can read about at [http://thinkdast.com/collections](http://thinkdast.com/collections). In particular, you should know about the `List` `interface` and the classes `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.


Ideally you should be familiar with Apache Ant, which is an automated build tool for Java.  You can read more about Ant at [http://thinkdast.com/anttut](http://thinkdast.com/anttut).


And you should be familiar with `JUnit`, which is a unit testing framework for Java.  You can read more about it at [http://thinkdast.com/junit](http://thinkdast.com/junit).
