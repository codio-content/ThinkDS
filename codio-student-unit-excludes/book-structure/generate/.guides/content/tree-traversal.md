This chapter introduces the application we will develop during the rest of the book, a web search engine. I describe the elements of a search engine and introduce the first application, a Web crawler that downloads and parses pages from Wikipedia.  This chapter also presents a recursive implementation of depth-first search and an iterative implementation that uses a Java `Deque` to implement a “last in, first out” stack.
